# Technical Coding Assessment

## Instructions
Welcome! This assessment consists of **3 coding problems** of varying difficulty.

**Problem List:**
1. **Device Status Bit-Packing Library** (Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐)
2. **Cascading Slot Mechanism** (Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐)
3. **Doubly Linked List** (Difficulty: ⭐⭐)

## Guidelines
* **Verification:** Your code will be verified against a suite of unit tests after submission.
* **Problems 1 & 2:** We have provided a `Program` class with a `Main` method containing basic sanity checks. Please write your implementation in the designated `// TODO` areas within the provided code blocks.
* **Problem 3:** Please implement the linked list logic. No `Main` method is required for this problem; it will be tested strictly via external unit tests.
